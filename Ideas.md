# From Reddit User hneriixh:

Hello!

I'm currently deeply involved in a computer association that has survived and thrived for over 40 years, with over 2000 students passing through.

The tricks seems to be:
- Pizza. I cannot emphasize this enough. Everyone loves pizza, and more importantly, 
    pizza gives people a moment to stop working on their projects and actually talk.
    The computer part of a club is not what the club is about, the club is all about the 
    people in it interacting with each other.

- Do other stuff than just computers and code. Go outside and play games. Take a walk. Make a podcast. 
    Drink coffee. (or mate if that's your thing (Edit: the 
    beverage, maybe not the other thing...]. Fire up the grill. Be social.

- Grab 'em while they are young. Get the freshmen actively interested in the club, see if 
    they want to take on responsibilities and let them do their thing.

- Try to involve both the school and local companies in your club. The companies get exposure to their core 
    demographic for hiring, 
    you get stuff/money for your 
    members. This is a win/win for everyone involved. See if the school can provide certain services for you, 
    for example providing power, rack space and network for 
    the old server you've just been given from that local company.

- An excellent way to get outsiders involved is to ask them to hold a lecture. That professor over there may very well be 
    interested in holding a lecture about her 
    most recent research to people that actually seem interested, instead of her usual boring students sleeping in the lecture 
    hall since the party last night. 
    In the same manner people from industry are often interested in coming and holding lectures/workshops about their research/
    product/project/.../.

- Get on a good footing with your local IT-department. For some reason one often need computers to do computer research, 
    and the IT-department has a bunch of 
    computers. They also have rack space, power, network and old servers.

- Provide resources to do stuff, not stuff to do. Provide for a place to gather, even if it's just the 
    school cafeteria once a week. 
    Try to get hold of some old s
    erver hardware (see r/homelab for inspiration), make joint pizza orders. Try to get some books donated. See if you can 
    get the school to give you a room. Get some
    chairs, an old workstation or two. Get a cheap electronics-kit donated to you, etc. This part may sound hard, until you 
    realize it's often cheaper for companies
    to donate old stuff than to throw it away or sell it.

- Don't try to do everything yourself. Make sure you get something out of it. Make sure you 
    remember your time at that club in a very positive way. 
    And make sure that you are not imperative for that clubs survival. Make sure that it 
    survives after you, and everyone you know, are gone.
    
# Every Club Day Needs:

Pizza, or some kind of food or snack. Having something to eat will encourage people to put down the code and talk to others. 

# Programming Competition

Goals
- Encourage Collaboration between members
- Build problem-solving skills with practical code
- Allow members to better understand how they can improve. 

Execution 
- Members are presented with a problem to solve.
- Members are in groups of 2 or 3. 
- Members have a time limit set (say, 1 hour, 1.5 hours). Whoever can solve the problem in completion the quickest wins the competition. 
- Keeping edge cases in mind, a moderator would check each teams' code. 
- Teams earn points for completion time, code readability, program speed, and covering edge cases. 

Potential Issues with this Idea
- Diversity of skill, some members are seniors, some are freshmen.

Example Problems
- Reverse only the letters of a string, ignoring numbers or special characters. (simple)
- Using recursion to calculate a GroupSum. => https://codingbat.com/prob/p145416 (advanced)
- Solving the partition problem, with recursion. => https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-problem-dp-18/ (advanced)

# Project Night

Bring-your-projects night. 

Goals
- Give aspiring developers the opportunity to work with more experienced developers on their projects. 
- Encourage collaboration and create opportunities for members to work together and form teams. 
- Discuss projects, ideas, and implementations. 

Potential Issues
- Not enough projects to work on.
- Becoming a homework night. 

# Github Night & VS Code Integration

Targeted at moving students from Eclipse into VS Code, teaching them to use Github, and how to sync files between Github and VS Code.

Goals
- Get new members on VS Code instead of Eclipse, a much more modern platform. 
- Teach an understanding of the concept of Git.
- Create a Github account
- Understanding Githubs' interface and uploading files manually. 
- Use the command line to initialize a new repository. 
- Syncing files between VS Code and Github. 
- Best practices when using Github. 

Potential Issues
- Members don't want to use VS Code. 
- Finding somebody who understands Git really well. 
- Issues with installing VS Code taking up time. 

# Partnering with local High / Middle / Elementary Schools to teach coding basics. 

We invite local schools to send students to UTC for a day, where we teach them the basics of coding with Java. For younger kids it may be better to use something like Scratch. 

Goals
- Teach students the basics of coding with Java/ Scratch/ other
- Opportunity for EVERYONE in the club to teach. 
- Give students a chance to see if they love to code. 

Potential Issues
- They're kids. 
- Transportation. 
- Getting schools to work with us. 

# Partnering with Businesses 

Partnering with businesses can give us access to people who can teach us what businesses expect from employees, and how to make yourself a more desirable candidate. 

# Programming Paradigms Talk. 

Teach students about the different programming paradigms, help them understand the differences. 

The paradigms are: 
- Object-Oriented
- Functional
- Imperative
- Logical
- Data-Oriented

Goals
- Help students understand their *options* better when choosing a language. 
- Give students an understanding of programming languages as a general concept. 

Potential Issues
- Finding a speaker. 

# Language Night

A night for someone who is fluent in a language that many others aren't to teach about what they know. For example, I could teach Rust, someone else could teach Javascript, and another could teach C#. 

Goals
- Provide members with a basic understanding of a new language. 

Potential Issues
- Finding teachers.
